The following is a sample of products created during the _"Data Visualization and Reproducible Research"_ course in Fall 2020 at [Florida Polytechnic University](https://floridapoly.edu/).

## Project 01

In the `project_01/` folder you can find a small project featuring a textual analysis of the Federalist Papers written by Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay. This textual analysis served as a test subject for some data preprocessing that would need to be done for my thesis. Visualizations here were built with a consistent and simplistic theme.

**Sample data visualization:**

## Project 02

In this project, I explored COVID-19 related tweets from July and August. I try to use kernel density estimation to locatate crude clusters of tweets based on graph kernel similarity measures; local minimums in the estimated density curve are located using discritized calculus. Find the code and report in the `project_02/` folder.

**Sample data visualization:**

## Project 03

In this project, I explored weather in Tampa, near my school.

### Moving Forward

These data samples represent some visualizations I made in the Fall of 2020 in my Data Visualization class. What I mostly learned, I think, is best displayed in my project 1 here, where I try to make simplistic and consistent themed plots. Through the course I did not learn too many new things about `{ggplot2}` (I already loved the pacakge! :smile: ), but what I did learn was how to reduce clutter, use color, use shape, etc to convey my point more effectively through visualization. Those design concepts will benefit me no matter what tools I use!
